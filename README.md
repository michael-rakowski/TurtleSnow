# TurtleSnow

This code uses the Python "Turtle" library, referring to its online Python 3 documentation (example "Turtle star" code and use, for a fractal-like Sun:  https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html), to then draw randomly located fractal-like snowflakes in a scene.  The idea behind fractal-like snowflakes is courtesy of GeeksforGeeks (GfG:  https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/snowflakes-fractal-using-python/ `via Subhajit Saha`) - yet the true inspiration, for all of this, spaked from demonstrating Python 3 coding to my eldest daughter, Aleena, during her 2019 Winter break.

This of course led to the modified and extended, for some cooler and developing "Turtle" use and fractals, of the "snowscene_aleena.py" code.  A good example of any further or upcoming Python 3 code development may be to include the use of the Koch Snowflake, for example:  https://python-with-science.readthedocs.io/en/latest/koch_fractal/koch_fractal.html

For an original or basic attempt, leading into other coding and interesting developments, in order, please first see the least modified  "snowflake.py", then "snowflake_withsun.py", and then "snowscene_aleena.py".  Each run as intended through an online Python IDE, with any Tkinter (XWindows) support, such as:  https://repl.it/languages/tkinter.  Please see each in their initial or header documentation, for their details that build from the prior.

The longer term expectation (~2020 year) is to take this code to some further extent and demonstration of Git (GitHub and Atlassian's BitBucket), Infrastructure as code (IaC), Containerization, CI/CD, DevOps (Jenkins and Atlassian's Bamboo), SecOps, etc.
