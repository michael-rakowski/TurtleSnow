## First GitHub repository!  -200106MR
# TurtleSnow

This code attempts to use the Python "Turtle" library, with its online Python 3 doc (example "Turtle star" code and use, for a fractal-like Sun:  https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html), to then draw randomly located fractal-like snowflakes in a scene - the idea behind fractal-like snowflakes is courtesy of GeeksforGeeks (GfG:  https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/snowflakes-fractal-using-python/ `via Subhajit Saha`)...  

...modified and extended, for some cooler and developing "Turtle" use and fractals of course.

The longer term expectation is to take this code to some further extent and demonstration of Git (GitHub), Infrastructure as code (IaC), etc.

For an original or basic attempt, leading into other coding and interesting developments in order, please first see the least modified  "snowflake.py", then "snowflake_withsun.py", and then "snowscene_aleena.py".
