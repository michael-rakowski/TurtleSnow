# TurtleSnow

This code uses the Python "Turtle" library, referring to its online Python 3 documentation (example "Turtle star" code and use, for a fractal-like Sun:  https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html), to then draw randomly located fractal-like snowflakes in a scene - the idea behind fractal-like snowflakes is courtesy of GeeksforGeeks (GfG:  https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/snowflakes-fractal-using-python/ `via Subhajit Saha`)...  

...modified and extended, for some cooler and developing "Turtle" use and fractals, by "snowscene_aleena.py", of course.  A good example of any upcoming development may be the use of the Koch Snowflake, for example:  https://python-with-science.readthedocs.io/en/latest/koch_fractal/koch_fractal.html

For an original or basic attempt, leading into other coding and interesting developments, in order, please first see the least modified  "snowflake.py", then "snowflake_withsun.py", and then "snowscene_aleena.py".  Each run as intended through an online Python IDE, with any Tkinter support, such as:  https://repl.it/languages/tkinter. 

The longer term expectation (~2020 year) is to take this code to some further extent and demonstration of Git (GitHub and Atlassian's BitBucket), Infrastructure as code (IaC), Containerization, CI/CD, DevOps (Jenkins and Atlassian's Bamboo), SecOps, etc.
